# UnityDeviceUniqueIdentifierHarness

A simple applet that launches a unity game instance to copy your unique system identifier. 

Originally created as a way of decrypting Overcooked 2 save files using https://github.com/hadeutscher/OvercookedTool.

If your Overcooked 2 save file was saved without signing into GOG or Steam it uses this identifier as the encryption (SHA-1) password.

### How to use
Download release and unpack. Then run \_UnityDeviceUniqueIdentifierHarness.exe. The string of letters and numbers you see on screen is your devices unique ID. Click copy to have it copied to your clipboard. App can be closed after.

### On requests
No feature extensions are planned for this tool but I will fix bugs if they arise.
